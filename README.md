WordPress Test Project
======================

## Project brief
Create a jobs list page pointing to individual job pages and a simple apply form.

On the **jobs list** page, a job will consist of:
- title
- description (truncated to 25 words)

On the **job page**, there will be: 
- position title
- company department (eg. Finance, Marketing, etc.)
- picture with default dimensions of 900 x 600px
- whether the job is On-site or Remote
- job description (can be a couple of paragraphs)
- apply button pointing to the apply page

Make all fields required in the WordPress admin. 

**Apply page** will have a simple form with the following elements:
- subject - required input field which will be automatically prefilled with *Re: [position title]* based on which position the user arrived from
- email - required / input field
- CV - optional / file upload dialog
- cover letter - optional / textarea
- submit button

The form can be sent to an email address or stored internally in WordPress.

## Requirements
1. Use the Outsourcify Wordpress Starter Theme
1. Use [Timber](https://github.com/timber/timber) and [ACF](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/)
1. For the form you can use a form plugin of your choice (Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms)
1. Add some minimal styling and make the pages responsive according your best judgement.
1. Make the pages the smallest possible size - optimize images, disable jQuery or any other unnecessary scripts/stylesheets, etc.
1. Set up a virtual host with your project repository name (eg. *yourname-wp-test.dev*) so we don't have search & replace URLs when testing your project
1. Store the whole WordPress installation into the test repository and also store a database dump to it. 

## Project Deadline
Take your time but try to deliver it within 2 weeks time. If we don't see any activity in your test repository after 2 weeks (at least initial commits), we will automatically withdraw your application.
